# Hangman

This a command line game of Hangman.
It mainly works by using two classes. 
A Word class that contains the word and its length. 
And a Game class that has different methods for the different steps of the game.
Then I used an initializing function to start the game by getting a user input.
This program uses getpass to hide the word from the other player when the player is prompted for a word. 
Also, I added a file that has the hangman drawings to the directory.
